# Boundary Intelligence Patterns

## Core Principle
Don't fight external systemsâ€”extract domain intelligence from them.

## Boundary Recognition
- **External systems**: AST nodes, HTTP requests, database rows, file formats
- **Domain models**: Your semantic understanding of external data
- **Extraction layer**: Pure functions that cross boundaries once
- **TypeAdapter**: Pydantic's tool for boundary validation

## Banned Boundary Patterns
- **Leaky abstractions** - Domain models wrapping external objects
- **Mixed logic** - Boundary crossing + domain logic in same function
- **Stateful extraction** - Services accumulating state during boundary crossing
- **Nested external dispatch** - Multiple levels of external type checking

## Required Boundary Patterns
- **Single extraction point** - One place per external system type
- **Immediate domain conversion** - External data becomes domain models quickly
- **Pure extraction functions** - Boundary crossing with no side effects
- **Explicit boundary classes** - Clear separation of boundary vs domain logic

## Boundary Design Rules
- External type checking only in extraction functions
- Domain models never import external system modules
- TypeAdapter for validation at system boundaries
- Functional visitors that produce domain models, not side effects
- Metadata extraction instead of direct external object wrapping

## Type System Boundary Principle
When discriminated unions provide stronger guarantees than static type checkers can verify:
- **Keep domain models strongly typed** - Never weaken types to satisfy MyPy
- **Use constructive transformation** - Unpack and explicitly type (see 000-sda-core)
- **Type ignore is LAST RESORT** - Only when construction truly impossible
- **Document domain guarantees** - If type ignore required, explain why it's safe
- **Trust discriminated unions over type checkers** - Domain models encode more intelligence than MyPy can verify
